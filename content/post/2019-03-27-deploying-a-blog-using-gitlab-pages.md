Honestly, its pretty easy, just used the built-in template from gitlab.com


Although as someone who has not used hugo before, that was a bit of a learning curve.

Another part that is a bit awkward is SSL certificates, soon I will have this website under HTTPS, but since all content here is static and public knowledge. there is not much incentive to do so. 

Till next time!
