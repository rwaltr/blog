Honestly, it is pretty easy, just use the built-in template from gitlab.com, You can redirect your DNS entry for your website to the yourusername.gitlab.io and it will load the proper pages, it is also free of cost. so its a quick way to save 5 bucks a month!


Although as someone who has not used hugo before, that was a bit of a learning curve.

Another part that is a bit awkward is SSL certificates, soon I will have this website under HTTPS, but since all content here is static and public knowledge. There is not much incentive to do so. 

Also, Make sure you are using your txt entries correctly for proper verification, dont fear to reach out to your DNS support if you dont think its working. 

Till next time!
