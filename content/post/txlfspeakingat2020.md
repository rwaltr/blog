I will be presenting a crash course in how to get a simple CI/CD pipeline going.

For everyone that is joining, Here is a quick heads up on what you will need.

## Grab these so that you are ready

- A Gitlab Account
  - Gitlab will need an email account
  - If you somewhat know git already. Highly recommend setting up an SSH key.
- Fedora Toolbox
  - Fedora Toolbox is not strictly required
  - Works best on Fedora!
- Git
  - Preinstalled on most Distros
- Hugo
  - Either inside the Toolbox container or on your base system.
