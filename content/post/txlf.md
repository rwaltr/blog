Majority of attendees seemed to be either individuals that work with linux most of the time in their day jobs, or hobbyists, not entirely surprising. Among those who worked with linux day to day, the word of the day was cloud.

Yeah, I know. **THAT** cloud.

## The Talks

Most of the talks assumed beginner knowledge of Linux, which is great for me, a long time Linux professional and hobbyist. However I brought along two friends...

- **One who was a Linux beginner**,
  - A fellow coworker on my support team.
      - Lets call him Tux
- **One with zero linux experience and is not technical**, 
  - My dear girlfriend who is *a theater and drama nut.* but interested in learning.
        - Lets call her Jane

## Day 1
###### The start of the Linuxing
### Ansible Beginner to Brilliant

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Going from <a href="https://twitter.com/ansible?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@ansible</a> basics to brilliance at the first session of the first day <a href="https://twitter.com/texaslinuxfest?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@texaslinuxfest</a> <a href="https://t.co/ltH6htGmVx">pic.twitter.com/ltH6htGmVx</a></p>&mdash; Chris Fisher (@ChrisLAS) <a href="https://twitter.com/ChrisLAS/status/1134463618899165185?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 31, 2019</a></blockquote>

One of the first talks of the day, and the first one Jane and myself attended, and the first one that I realized I didn't have my laptop

This talk assumed zero knowledge of Ansible, which is great I thought. The first half covered topics I already knew. But unfortunately I had to leave the talk midway though, Otherwise it was a great and knowledge talk that catered to a lot of people.
