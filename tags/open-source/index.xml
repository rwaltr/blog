Some of you will no longer desire to place your code on github, but where can you place your code now? Thankfully, Open Source culture prevails with multiple options!
Gitlab is feature-wise identical (if not more featured) to github, You can host either your own instance or use theirs. What freedom!
My employer uses this software for in house code, their features are paramount and their self hosting option allows those with even the tightest security policies to have their cake and eat it too with Gitlabâ€™s advance CI/CD pipelines!</description></item></channel></rss>
