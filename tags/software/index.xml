It has no authentication, authorization, or any fancy abilities such as listing the directory of files you are looking at.
TFTP was created as a “streamlined” way to send and receive files from devices, especially devices with little to “no” compute resources. For example; one common use is to load firmware and software packages to Cisco devices using an internally managed repository on a TFTP server.</description></item><item><title>FTP is NOT secure software.</title><link>https://blog.waltr.tech/post/ftp-is-not-secure/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Jul 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>rwalt@pm.me (Ryan W.

However, it is not a service you should use to host sensitive information. The following is why,
FTP does not perform encryption on transit; Anyone between you and the FTP server can, will, and most likely have been monitoring and logging traffic.
FTP does not securely communicate credentials; FTP does not encrypt authentication, this means that passwords are in plain text and can be READ BY ANYONE monitoring your network.</description></item><item><title>GitHub acquired from Microsoft</title><link>https://blog.waltr.tech/post/github-aquired/</link><pubDate>Fri, 08 Jun 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>rwalt@pm.me (Ryan W.

Some of you will no longer desire to place your code on github, but where can you place your code now? Thankfully, Open Source culture prevails with multiple options!
Gitlab is feature-wise identical (if not more featured) to github, You can host either your own instance or use theirs. What freedom!
My employer uses this software for in house code, their features are paramount and their self hosting option allows those with even the tightest security policies to have their cake and eat it too with Gitlab’s advance CI/CD pipelines!</description></item></channel></rss>
